# ssnake

**ssnake** is a simple snake game written in JavaScript that uses HTML5 `<canvas>`. 

I wrote it *a long* time ago when the canvas tag had just appeared and I was curious how it worked. 

[You can try it here](http://crdx.github.io/ssnake). (Warning: flashing colours ahead.)

Disclaimer: the code reflects by no means the standard of code I write today. Unless you think it's great, in which case it definitely does.
